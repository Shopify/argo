# Testing on a shop

Once your Argo Extension is ready, push your code to Shopify and publish a version to see your extension in a Shopify store.

**Note:** Currently, you need to publish a version of your extension before running it on a Shopify store.

1. Run `shopify register` in the CLI to register your extension to your app.
2. Run `shopify push` to push your code to Shopify.

```bash
shopify push
```

3. Navigate to the extension's management page on the Partners Dashboard.

4. The code you pushed to Shopify is stored as a draft on this page. Create a new version of the extension from the Draft.

5. Publish the version you created to take it live for all stores that have this app installed.
