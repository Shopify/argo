# Contributing

We provide the libraries in this repo as public NPM packages so that they can be installed and used in your local project. Because the packages are public, we have also made the repo public. This way, you can easily refer to the in-code comments we use for documenting Argo APIs. However, the code in this repo is not a traditional open source project.

These packages act as the public API Shopify is exposing for UI extensions in our applications, and as a result, we **are not accepting contributions that change or add to these APIs**. Any change to these repos is typically only one part of the full required change, with the rest being done in private Shopify repos that third-party developers do not have access to.

Though we are not accepting contributions, weâ€™d still love to hear from you! If you have ideas for new components or APIs, please [raise an issue on this repo](https://github.com/Shopify/argo/issues/new/choose). We will also happily accept pull requests for fixing typos in the documentation. If you do raise an issue or PR on this repo, please read [the code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which all contributors must adhere to.
