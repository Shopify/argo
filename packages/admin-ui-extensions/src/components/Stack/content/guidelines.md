## Guidelines

- ðŸ“± All children of Stack are placed in a single view object, which makes recycling the views expensive and results in poorer performance when scrolling. Consider keeping your Stacks simple.
- By default, Stacks alignment is `'leadingâ€™`.
- Distribution is ignored for vertical stacks

| ðŸ“± Keep Stacks narrow. There is typically more vertical space than horizontal     | ðŸ“± Use complex and deep Stack layouts |
| ðŸ“± Keep Horizontal Stacks shallow. Complex hierarchies have performance penalties |                                       |
