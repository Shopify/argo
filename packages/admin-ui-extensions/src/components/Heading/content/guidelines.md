- ðŸ“± Use Headings to highlight the most important concept or piece of information merchants need to know

| âœ… Do                                                           | ðŸ›‘ Don't                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Use headings to support the hierarchy and structure of the page | Nest too many Headings in one area |
| Place Headings at the top of a page or section they refer to    |                                    |
