# Argo Playground

Argo Playground is a demo environment used for internal Argo development. It is distinct from the "Simulator" which refers to environment created by the [`argo-admin-cli`](https://github.com/Shopify/argo-admin-cli) project.

Develop and test `argo-admin` and `argo-admin-react` changes in the Playground with the
understanding that it is not a perfect replica of the [`web`](https://github.com/Shopify/web) host.
