## Best practices

- Use bullets for a text-only list of related items that donâ€™t need to be in a specific order
- Use numbers for a text-only list of related items when an inherent order, priority, or sequence needs to be communicated
- Use no marker when you want the semantic value of a list, like a list of links
- Lists should break up chunks of related content to make the information easier for merchants to scan
- Lists should be phrased consistently (try to start each item with a noun or a verb and be consistent with each item)
