## Best practices

- Use for whole numbers where a customer is likely to choose a number within a small range, like changing the quantity from one to two. When requiring decimals, a text field might be better.
- If thereâ€™s no default number, such as a customer choosing a shoe size, consider another component such as a [select](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/Select) component.
