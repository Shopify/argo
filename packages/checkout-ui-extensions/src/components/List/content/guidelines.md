## Best practices

- Lists should break up chunks of related content to make the information easier for customers to scan.
- Lists should be consistently phrased. Try to start each item with a noun or a verb and be consistent with each item.
- Use bullets for a text-only list of related items that donâ€™t need to be in a specific order.
- Use numbers for a text-only list of related items when an order, priority, or sequence needs to be communicated.
- Use no marker when only the semantic value of a list matters, such as with a list of links.
