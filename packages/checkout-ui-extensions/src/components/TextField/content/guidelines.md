## Best practices

- Clearly label the text field so it’s obvious what customers should enter into the field.
- Label text fields as optional when you need to request input that’s not required, like “First name (optional)“. When it’s optional, fields should not pass `true` to the `required` prop.
- Only ask for information that’s really needed.
