## Best practices

- Provide useful, additional information or clarification.
- Be succinct when you describe or expand on the element that the tooltip points to.
- Display tooltips when icons are selected or when a keyboard shortcut is used.
- Don't use tooltips to communicate critical information, including errors in forms and in other interaction feedback.
- Don't add links or buttons.
- Use tooltips sparingly. If youâ€™re building something that requires a lot of tooltips, work on clarifying the design and the language in the experience instead.
