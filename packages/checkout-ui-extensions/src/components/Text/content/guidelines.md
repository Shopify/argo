## Best practices

- Use larger text when you want to emphasize content thatâ€™s not a heading, like a price total
- Use subdued if the text is less important than its surrounding text, like placeholder text

- [HeadingGroup](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/HeadingGroup): Controls the H level of headings when nested within it, like H1, H2, H3.
- [TextBlock](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/TextBlock): Used to render a block of text that occupies the full width available, like a paragraph.
