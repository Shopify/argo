## Best practices

- Use this component when a customer is likely to choose a number within a small range. For example, when changing a quantity from one to three.
- If thereâ€™s no default number, consider choosing another component such as a [Text Field](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/TextField) or [Select](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/Select) component.
