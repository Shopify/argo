## Best practices

- Only use buttons that follow the best practices outlined in the [`Button`](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/Button) component.
- Group together calls to action that have a relationship.
- Don't use too many calls to action, because they can make customers unsure of what to do next.
- Be thoughtful about how multiple buttons will look and work on small screens.
