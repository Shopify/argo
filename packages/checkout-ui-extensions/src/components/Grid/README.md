| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| columns? | <code>"extraSmall" &#124; "small" &#124; "base" &#124; "large" &#124; "extraLarge"[] &#124; "extraSmall" &#124; "small" &#124; "base" &#124; "large" &#124; "extraLarge"</code> | Sizes for each column of the layout.<br /><br /> `auto`: intrinsic size of the content.<br /><br />`fill`: fills the remaining available space. When multiple columns are set to `fill`, the remaining space is shared equally.<br /><br />`Unit&lt;'%' | 'fr'&gt;`: size in percentages `%` or fractions `fr`.<br /><br />`number`: size in pixels.<br /><br /> - When the sum of the defined sizes is larger than the available space, elements will shrink to avoid overflow.<br /><br />- When only one size is set and outside of an array, the grid will have one column of that size.<br /><br />Default value: <code>'fill'</code> |
| rows? | <code>"extraSmall" &#124; "small" &#124; "base" &#124; "large" &#124; "extraLarge"[] &#124; "extraSmall" &#124; "small" &#124; "base" &#124; "large" &#124; "extraLarge"</code> | Sizes for each row of the layout.<br /><br /> `auto`: intrinsic size of the content.<br /><br />`fill`: fills the remaining available space.

| spacing? | <code>"none" &#124; "extraTight" &#124; "tight" &#124; "base" &#124; "loose" &#124; "extraLoose"</code> | Adjust spacing between children<br /><br />Default value: <code>'none'</code> |
