## Best practices

- Only use this component on the post-purchase page and never display more than one.
- Place callout banners near the top of the page to catch the customer's attention.
- Clearly articulate the benefit of the feature and what it does, and then give a clear call to action.
- Be considerate by avoiding exclamation points and anxiety-provoking language.
