## Guidelines

- Only use this component on the post-purchase page and never display more than one.
- Place callout banners near the top of the page to catch customers’ attention.
- Target customers who will most benefit from the feature.
- Clearly articulate the benefit of the feature and what it does, and then give a clear call to action.
- Be considerate by avoiding anxiety-provoking language and exclamation points. For example, “Wait! Before time runs out!”
